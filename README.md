# Running Both Projects in Visual Studio Code

**Note: This project uses .NET 10 SDK locally. Azure deployment currently uses .NET 9 until Azure Static Web Apps adds .NET 10 support.**

To launch both the Blazor PWA (SFA_PWA) and the WebAPI backend (SFA_WebAPI) in development:

1. Open two terminals in VS Code.
2. In the first terminal, run:
	```pwsh
	dotnet run --project SFA_PWA/SFA_PWA.csproj
	```
3. In the second terminal, run:
	```pwsh
	dotnet run --project SFA_WebAPI/SFA_WebAPI.csproj
	```
4. Make sure your Blazor app’s API calls use the correct backend URL (http://localhost:5216/api/bot/chat).

You can copy and paste these commands directly into your VS Code terminals.
