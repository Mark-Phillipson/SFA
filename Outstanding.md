Short term what we need to do:

 - Change the WhatsApp links to actual WhatsApp links.

 - Possibly purchase an actual domain instead of using:

  - https://polite-sand-0eb4b4703.3.azurestaticapps.net/

Long Term:

 - Possibly create an Android and iPhone App to publish into the relevant stores. (Utilizing RazorClassLibrary  and Blazor Hybrid tachnology).


  
Both of these domains are available £1 for year and then £10 per year:
