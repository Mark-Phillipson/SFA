Hey Russell! 👋

Just wanted to share a quick update about the proposed new app 📱:

✨ What it does:
- The app brings together useful links and weather info in one place 🌦️🔗
- You can easily check the latest updates and find important resources with a single tap 👍

🛠️ How to use:
- Open the app and browse the main menu to find links and other features (https://polite-sand-0eb4b4703.3.azurestaticapps.net/)
- A link to join a particular group could be added once supplied
- Check the weather section for local forecasts

📄 The specification document is temporarily included and may need revising.

🙏 Could you take a look and let me know what you think? Any feedback or issues with this approach would be super helpful! If you spot any problems or have suggestions, just reply here.

It's just a normal webapp at the moment but is also a PWA so can be installed on phones for easier access.

We could make it a native app later if needed (Android/iOS). Also the link at the moment is just what's provided free by Azure Static Web Apps, we can set up a custom domain if needed.

Thanks a lot! 😊
