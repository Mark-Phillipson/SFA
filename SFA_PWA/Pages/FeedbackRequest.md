Hello everyone,

I have created a webapp, possibly for use by club members.

It can be accessed at the following link: [SFA PWA](https://polite-sand-0eb4b4703.3.azurestaticapps.net/)

If anybody wants to try it out and give me feedback that would be great!

It can be opened on a phone or desktop browser, with the option to install it as a PWA (Progressive Web App) on supported devices.
