Would it be possible to add more than just Maidstone as a link in the bbc weather.

For example it would be great if we could do something in a twenty mile radius of Maidstone any major town or village

Maybe a dropdown to select a particular location and then the button can be clicked to launch the weather?


Also would it be possible to have the Maidstone weather in an Iframe showing directly on the page?
