Could we build a AI bot  that would use the text file attached and be able to search the san Ferry and Cycling Club Website for specific information based on user queries? The bot should be able to understand natural language questions and provide accurate responses by extracting relevant data from the website content. Additionally, it should be capable of handling various topics related to the club, such as membership details, event schedules, and cycling routes.

 it could also be an expert on cycle roots using Strava or RideWithGps.

  the main problem I believe is storing the open AI API key.

   we could use a old older model that is free can you see any problems with this approach?
