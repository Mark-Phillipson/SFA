 can we add a new feature to the cafes list  can we add a new column location for example if the cafes is in the radius of Marden  then add the location Marden.

  this would allow the user to type in a location and list all cafes near there

   can you research the best way to do this as we do have the geolocation of each cafe stored in the  CSV file.

    the best scenario would be able to type in any location and it returned the closest cafes to that location
