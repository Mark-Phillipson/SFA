How to Install a Progressive Web App (PWA) on a Google Pixel 6a

Compatibility:
- The Google Pixel 6a runs Android and supports Chrome, which has full PWA install support.
- PWAs are compatible with all modern Android devices, including the Pixel 6a, as long as you use Chrome or another browser with PWA support (e.g., Edge, Firefox).

Installation Steps:
1. Open Chrome on your Pixel 6a.
2. Navigate to the PWA site you want to install. (https://polite-sand-0eb4b4703.3.azurestaticapps.net/)
3. If the site meets install criteria (has a manifest, is HTTPS, etc.), you’ll see an “Install” icon in the address bar or a prompt at the bottom.
4. Tap “Install” (or use the Chrome menu > “Add to Home screen”).
5. The app will be added to your home screen and app drawer, and will launch in its own window.

Requirements for the PWA:
- Served over HTTPS.
- Has a valid web app manifest (with name, icons, start_url, display).
- No prefer_related_applications: true in the manifest (otherwise, it will prompt for Play Store app).
- User must interact with the site (at least one click/tap, 30 seconds on page).
