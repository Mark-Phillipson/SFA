How to Install a Progressive Web App (PWA) on a Google Pixel 6a

Compatibility:
- The Google Pixel 6a runs Android and supports Chrome, which has full PWA install support.
- PWAs are compatible with all modern Android devices, including the Pixel 6a, as long as you use Chrome or another browser with PWA support (e.g., Edge, Firefox).

Installation Steps (Google Pixel 6a / Chrome):
1. Open Chrome on your Pixel 6a.
2. Navigate to the PWA site you want to install (example: https://polite-sand-0eb4b4703.3.azurestaticapps.net/).
3. Check whether Chrome shows an install icon in the address bar — this means the PWA is installable. If you see the install icon, tap it.
4. If you don’t see the icon, open the Chrome menu (three dots in the top-right) and select <b>Install app</b> or <b>Add to Home screen</b>.
5. Chrome will show a preview and ask you to confirm — tap <b>Add</b> or <b>Install</b>.
6. After installing, the app icon appears on the Home screen and in the app drawer. The app should open in a standalone window (no address bar) if the manifest has <code>display: standalone</code>.

Save and remove from the Home screen:
- To save again after removal: Re-open the site in Chrome and follow the steps above.
- To remove: long-press the app icon on the home screen and choose <b>Remove</b> or <b>Uninstall</b> depending on your launcher.
- Confirm it's a PWA: open from the home screen — a PWA opens like a native app without the browser UI if correctly configured.

- Served over HTTPS.
- Has a valid web app manifest (with name, icons, start_url, display).
- No prefer_related_applications: true in the manifest (otherwise, it will prompt for Play Store app).
- User must interact with the site (at least one click/tap, 30 seconds on page).
Requirements for the PWA:
- The app must be served over HTTPS.
- Your app must include a valid web app manifest with the required members (name or short_name, icons sized 192x192 and 512x512, start_url, and display).
- Optionally add a service worker to enable offline support and improve installability — the browser sometimes looks for a service worker before showing the install prompt.
- If your manifest includes <code>prefer_related_applications</code> and it’s set to true, Chrome may prefer recommending a Play Store version instead.
